# Optimize Images X [![Github commits (since latest release)](https://img.shields.io/github/commits-since/victordomingos/optimize-images-x/latest.svg)](https://github.com/victordomingos/optimize-images-x) ![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/optimize-images-x) ![PyPI - Downloads](https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/optimize-images-x)
A desktop app written in Python, that exposes and unlocks the full power of 
[Optimize Images](https://github.com/victordomingos/optimize-images) in a nice 
graphical user interface, to help you reduce the file size of images.

![Optimize Images X - Main Window](https://github.com/victordomingos/optimize-images-x/blob/main/screenshots/optimize-images-x_main-window.png?raw=true)

Optimize Images X and its CLI companion `optimize-images` offer some useful 
features that are not always present in a single package, like batch downsizing 
of images within a folder (and recursively though its 
subfolders) based on specified maximum width and/or height.

If you were just looking for the original (and slightly faster) command-line 
user interface (CLI) version of this application, it's a separate project: 
[Optimize Images](https://github.com/victordomingos/optimize-images). 

## Installation and dependencies:

To install and run this application, you need to have a working
Python 3.7+ installation. We try to keep the external dependencies at a minimum, 
in order to keep compatibility with different  environments. At this moment, we 
require:

  - optimize-images==1.5.0
  - Pillow==8.2.0
  - piexif==1.1.3
  - watchdog==2.1.2
  
At this time we don't have a simple installer (but that would be cool), and no
launcher is made available outside of the command-line shell. As it stands
right now, it is required to have Python and its shell command `pip` on your
system. You can use `pip` to install the most recent release from the PyPI 
repository:

```
python3.9 -m pip install optimize-images-x
```

It can be a good idea to keep this kind of Python apps isolated in their own 
virtual environments, so a useful tool is a third-party tool named 
[pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx). Instead of the command indicated above
you could then use this one:

```
pipx install optimize-images-x
```

After that, to run the application, just type `optimize-images-x` in the 
Terminal and press `Enter`.

It should also run ok in Python 3.10, but please notice there is a nasty 
visual glitch related to tcl/tk that makes image buttons look bad, when 
using the `Aqua` theme. If you find that issue, just go to settings and 
switch to another theme.

If you are able to swap Pillow with the faster version 
[Pillow-SIMD](https://github.com/uploadcare/pillow-simd), you should be able
to get a considerably faster speed. For that reason, we provide, as a 
friendly courtesy, an optional shell script (`replace_pillow__macOS.sh`) to 
replace Pillow with the faster Pillow-SIMD on macOS. Please notice, however, 
that it usually requires a compilation step, and it was not throughly tested 
by us, so your mileage may vary.


## How to use

To start compressing images, just add one or more files, or a folder. The 
process starts as soon as the files are added to the list.

After launching the application for the first time, make sure all settings are 
configured as desired. The application's default settings are similar to the 
ones in Optimize Images. Whenever you change a setting it is applied 
immediately, and it's saved in the app's database, so that it will be can be 
used again the next time you run the app, without any need to go through all the 
settings. 

In simple terms, always make sure you have configured Optimize Images X as you 
want it, but if you just want to use the same settings from last time, just add 
images.

## Preferences

If you have used Optimize Images before, you probably already know what options 
are available. If not, please take a few minutes to take a look at the 
Preferences window and its tabs. You will find a description of each option on 
the original documentation for the command-line based Optimize Images.

#### User interface options

You can choose the graphical user interface theme in the `More…` tab of the 
Settings Window. The list of available themes will vary depending on your 
operating system, as well as Python and TK/tcl versions. Just click each one of 
the radio buttons, and it will be appplied immediately as you click.


#### Restoring default settings

One important feature of Optimize Images X is its opinionated choice of default 
app and task settings, which have been defined with the web in mind and are 
probably just fine when you just want to apply some compression to the final 
images to be deployed with you website. So, being able to restore them is also 
possible. You will find the `Reset all settings` button in the `More…` tab of 
the Settings Window. 

Restoring default settings requires that the application is restarted, which is 
done automatically. So, before resetting, you should make sure you there are no 
more tasks pending or being processed.

Its worth noting that this process will also reset previous choices regarding 
confirmation dialog boxes, so they will be shown up again even if you had chosen 
not to see them.

**DISCLAIMER:  
Please note that the operation is done DESTRUCTIVELY, by replacing the
original files with the processed ones. You definitely should duplicate the
source file or folder before using this utility, in order to be able to
recover any eventual damaged files or any resulting images that don't have the
desired quality.**
